1)How I approached this Assignment

1.Setup and Libraries: Imported necessary libraries like pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, TextBlob, and nltk. Ensured nltk packages were downloaded.

2.Data Reading: Loaded URLs from an input Excel file into a DataFrame.

3.Article Extraction:

a. Created a directory to save articles.
b. Defined a function extract_article to fetch and parse articles from the URLs, extracting titles and paragraphs.
c. Article Processing:
d. Iterated through each URL, extracted the article, and saved it to a text file.

4.Text Analysis:
a. Defined functions to count syllables, compute various textual metrics (e.g., sentiment scores, average sentence length), and analyze text complexity.
b. Loaded positive and negative words for sentiment analysis.
c. Results Compilation:
d. Analyzed each saved article and compiled metrics into a results list.

5.Output:
a. Converted the results into a DataFrame and saved them to both Excel and CSV files.


2)How to run the .py file to generate output
Prepare Your Environment:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using 'pip'

place Input Files:
Make sure Input.xlsx, positive-words.txt, and negative-words.txt are in the same directory as your script, or adjust the file paths in the script accordingly.
Run the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your script is located using the cd command.

Run the script using Python:
python script.py
After the script finishes running, check the output files Output Data Structure.xlsx and Output Data Structure.csv in the same directory as your script for the results.

3)Include all dependencies required
import pandas as pd
import os
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from textblob import TextBlob
import re
import nltk
